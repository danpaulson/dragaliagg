# Dragalia.gg

A site for Dragalia Lost endgame builds & comps.

## I have a complaint!

Please open a [Github Issue](https://github.com/jedi-gg/dragaliagg/issues) if there's something we can help with or improve.

## When is my feature going to be ready!!

You can follow our progress on the [Development board](https://github.com/jedi-gg/dragaliagg/projects/1). Note that Dragalia.gg is a side project, not currently monetized and the result of a lot of work during our free time! Development speed may ebb and flow!

## I want to make the site better myself!!!

This site is open source, but more as a hypothetical idea versus a real, live open source project. If enough interest is shown, I will document the process of spinning up a local environment and doing development.

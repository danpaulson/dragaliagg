    "creators_notes": "“So even though this fight is now a month old and therefore Dead Content™ I still see some people asking around for auto eAsura comps. And many of them, like me, lack the core units for the established tank comp and AoE comp strategies. While you can get 70-80% consistent autos off of throwing 3 dps+healer teams together, I wanted something that could do actual afk farming, and this was the result. A somewhat flexible comp built around the world’s most useless wyrmprint, Beneath the Boughs. Hope this helps at least a few of you get those 4 copies of bow’s boon unlocked.”\r\n\r\n– LeonDL",
